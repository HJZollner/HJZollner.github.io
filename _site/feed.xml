        <title>MRITogether Workshop - Showcasing  an  open-science  environment  for  rapid  benchmarking  of  new  1H-MRS  methods</title>
        <description>
          
          Excited to present our open-source environment for rapid benchamrking of new 1H-MRS methods combining state-of-the-art MRS processing and LCM analysis with Osprey and visualization with SpecVis.

Come and join us at the MRITogether Workshop organized by the ESMRMB for free! Visit me at my poster.

        <title>Comparison of linear combination modeling strategies for edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3T</title>
        <description>
          
          Happy to announce that our paper about Linear-combination modeling of GABA-edited MRS is now available at NMR in Biomedicine. A well-parameterized macromolecule (MM) basis function at 3 ppm improved overall modeling performance.

GABA-edited MRS is best quantified by LCM with a well-parameterized coedited MM basis function constraint to the non-overlapped macromolecule peak at 0.9 ppm combined with sparse spline knot spacing and modeling range between 0.5 and 4 ppm. /2

          Happy and proud to have won a poster award for reproducible MRS research at the annual ISMRM MR Spectroscopy Study Group Business Meeting. I presented a pitch on my latest ISMRM abstract ‘Linear-combination modeling of GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS at 3T: Evaluating different modeling strategies’ which is already avaialbe as preprint!

Congratulations to all other presenters!

        <title>Comparison of linear combination modeling strategies for GABA-edited MRS at 3T</title>
        <description>
          
          Our new preprint is out! We evaluated different modeling strategies for linear combination modeling of GABA-edited MRS at 3T. Parameterizing the co-edited macromolecules at 3-ppm improved overall fitting performance. Different modeling strategies were tested: combining six approaches to account for co-edited MMs, three modeling ranges, three baseline knot spacings, and using basis sets with and without homocarnosine. Significantly different GABA+ and GABA estimates were found when a well-parameterized MM basis function at 3 ppm was included. The mean GABA estimates were significantly lower when modeling MM, while CVs remained similar. Sparser knot spacing led to lower variation in the GABA...

        <title>SpecVis v.1.0.0 Release</title>
        <description>
          
          

I’m happy to announce the release of SpecVis v.1.0.0 today. This R repository includes a number of functions to create reproducible and information rich plots for transparent data reporting.

The functions are freely avaialbe on the SpecVis GitHub.

If you have any suggestions please contact me,

        <title>MRSinMRS markdown in Osprey</title>
        <description>
          
          Dear MRS community, we are happy to announce a new module in Osprey that automatically creates a table following the consensus recommendations. The output format is markdown which allows opening in any text editor independently of your OS. The final document can easily be used to generate a PDF to attach for publication. Hopefully, this easy and open implementation allows other developers to join us and make this a standard output of any MRS analysis software. This could be very helpful to further increase the standardization and transparency of MRS studies. The new module will be included in the next...
