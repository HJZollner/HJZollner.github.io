<p>#You’ll find this post in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>#Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p>#<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>#Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>#Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<p>#</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1">#def print_hi(name)</span>
<span class="c1">#  puts "Hi, #{name}"</span>
<span class="c1">#end</span>
<span class="c1">#print_hi('Tom')</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span></code></pre></figure>
