Happy and proud to have won a poster award for reproducible MRS research at the annual ISMRM MR Spectroscopy Study Group Business Meeting. I presented a pitch on my latest ISMRM abstract 'Linear-combination modeling of GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS at 3T: Evaluating different modeling strategies' which is already available as [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.26.445817)!

Congratulations to all other presenters!

Thank you to those who contributed to this work - my mentors and supervisors [Georg Oeltzschner](https://www.specfitlab.com/) and [Richard Edden](http://www.gabamrs.com/).
