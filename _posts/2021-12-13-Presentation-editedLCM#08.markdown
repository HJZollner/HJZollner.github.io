Excited to present our open-source environment for rapid benchmarking of new 1H-MRS methods combining state-of-the-art MRS processing and LCM analysis with [Osprey](https://github.com/schorschinho/osprey) and visualization with [SpecVis](https://github.com/HJZollner/SpecVis).

*Proposed open-science environment for rapid benchmarking of new 1H-MRS methods. The environment embbeds state-of-the-art MRS processing and LCM analysis with comprehensive visualization. Futhter large publicly avaialbe datasets are utilized for reproducibility and accessibility. Finally, early adoption and wide dissemination is fostered by the use of preprint servers.*

Come and join us at the [MRITogether Workshop](https://mritogether.github.io/) organized by the ESMRMB for free! Visit me at my poster.
