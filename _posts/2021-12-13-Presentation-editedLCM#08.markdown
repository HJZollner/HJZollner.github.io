Excited to present our open-source environment for rapid benchamrking of new 1H-MRS methods combining state-of-the-art MRS processing and LCM analysis with [Osprey](https://github.com/schorschinho/osprey) and visualization with [SpecVis](https://github.com/HJZollner/SpecVis).

Come and join us at the [MRITogether Workshop](https://mritogether.github.io/) organized by the ESMRMB for free! Visit me at my poster.
