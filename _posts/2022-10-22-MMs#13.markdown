Happy to announce my new paper in [NMR in Biomedicine](https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4854) on the feasibility and implications of subjects-specififc macromolecular spectra. Inclusion of a single high SNR MM basis function leads to lower model residuals and AIC values compared to all other MM strategies.

Another exciting aspect of this work is the integration of multiple LCM analyses into a single statistical model potenitally allows to identify the robustness in the detection fo underlying effects (e.g., metabolite vs. age), reduces algorithm-based bias, and estiamtes alogithm-related variance.

All results and code are available on [OSF](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/7DXNM). The data can be found on [NITRC](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mm_mrs/).

All methods are implemented in Osprey and are free to use for your own study!
