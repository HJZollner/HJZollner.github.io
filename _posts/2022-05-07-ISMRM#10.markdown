Finally in-person ISMRM again. Come by one of my digital posters about the impact of measured MM background signals on the quantification of short-TE MRS and GABA-edited MRS. Or learn about the impacto fo retrospective motion-compensation on GABA-edited multi-slice MRSI.

I am also excited to present Osprey in the Tutorials for the whole community session. This includes a quick pitch and podium discussion about open-source development and a longer tutorial on how to use Osprey for your MRS research.
