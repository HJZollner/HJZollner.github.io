Happy to announce that our paper about Linear-combination modeling of [GABA-edited MRS](https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4618) is now available at NMR in Biomedicine. A well-parameterized macromolecule (MM) basis function at 3 ppm improved overall modeling performance.

GABA-edited MRS is best quantified by LCM with a well-parameterized coedited MM basis function constraint to the non-overlapped macromolecule peak at 0.9 ppm combined with sparse spline knot spacing and modeling range between 0.5 and 4 ppm.
