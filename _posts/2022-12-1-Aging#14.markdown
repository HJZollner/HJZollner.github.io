New work in NeuroImage from my colleague Tao Gong about the neurometabolic timecourse of healthy aging measured with short TE MRS. This large cross-sectional cohort showed significant correlations for tCho, tCr, mI, and sI in CSO and for NAAG, tCho, tCr, and Gln in PCC. The data was analyzed in Osprey.

All results and code are available on [OSF](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/UPNKD). The data can be found on [NITRC](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mm_mrs/).

A new voxel overlap method was implemted in Osprey for this work and is now available for you to use!
