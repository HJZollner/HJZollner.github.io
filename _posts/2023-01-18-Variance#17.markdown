Do we have to rethink our statistical analysis approaches for 1H-MRS studies? This work by James Prisciandaro suggests that more than half of the total variability in metabolite estimates are explained by a single common factor. The Big PRESS dataset was processed in Osprey and metabolite estimation was performed in LCModel.
