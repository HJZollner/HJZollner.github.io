Are you afraid of loosing your MRS data during a MRS application study? Check out our new preprint on [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.03.515056). Here we present a continuous automated MRS analysis workflow. This workflow integrates automated data sorting, conversion to NIfTI-MRS, analysis in Osprey, and automated reproting of the results.

This workflow can reduce the burden of manual data analysis and quality control.

The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/HJZollner/ContinuousAnalysisMRS).
