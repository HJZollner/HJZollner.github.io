Incredible work by my colleague Alexander Craven on the comparison of seven modelling algorithms for GABA-edited 1 H-MRS now published in [NMR in Biomedicine](https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4702)! This work found that moderate agreement between 7 LCM algorthms for GABA-edited MRS extending prior findings on the agreement of LCM in short TE PRESS MRS data. Addtionally, it confirms our recent findings, that including a dedicated MM model for the co-edited macormolecules at 0.9 ppm improves overall quantificaiton in terms of the agreement between different algorithms.
